# Automatic-Band-Controller-Radioberry
This is a simple band controller for Radioberry. 
All bands are working. Only problem on the moment is 12M code. 

I try to find the right code for it. 
The software is free to use. The software is part of an existing software found on Github. The software was designed for an Alex control based on 4 bits. However, the filters I use are from old transmitters. Here you have to control each filter separately. 

In my case 9 BPF bands. In this case I have adjusted the software so that each band receives a switch-on pulse when you change bands. It should be noted that the 12M band is not yet operational. It is equivalent to the 10M band. 

As soon as this software problem is resolved, I will ensure that the correct version becomes available.
